# Sudoku Solver

This is a **Sudoku Solver** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides a clean, intuitive, and interactive interface to solve and reset Sudoku puzzles. It allows users to enter values, validate inputs, and see the solution generated through a backtracking algorithm.

## Features

- **Sudoku Grid**: The 9x9 grid is dynamically created, and users can enter values (numbers 1-9) into the cells.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that only valid numbers (1-9) are entered, and checks for duplicates in the rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.
- **Solve Puzzle**: Solves the Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.
- **Reset Board**: Clears the current input and solution to start fresh.
- **Error Messages**: Displays error messages for invalid inputs or unsolvable grids.

## UI Design

- The design features a dark theme with bright, contrasting colors for input validation.
- User-entered numbers are highlighted with an **orange** color, while the numbers generated by the algorithm appear in **white**.
- Error messages are shown in **red** to easily grab attention when an invalid input is detected.
- The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop.

## How to Use

1. Enter a Sudoku puzzle by clicking on the cells and typing numbers (1-9).
2. If any invalid input is detected (such as a duplicate or a number outside the valid range), an error message will appear.
3. Press the **Solve** button to find the solution for the puzzle.
4. Press the **Reset** button to clear the grid and start a new puzzle.

## Algorithm

The puzzle is solved using a **backtracking algorithm**, which tries all possible values (1-9) for empty cells, checks if they’re valid based on Sudoku rules, and continues until the puzzle is solved or determined to be unsolvable.

### Backtracking steps:
- Find an empty cell.
- Try placing a number (1-9) and check if it’s valid.
- If valid, move to the next empty cell.
- If an invalid placement is encountered, backtrack and try the next possible number.

## Key Concepts

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that user inputs conform to Sudoku’s constraints, such as avoiding duplicate numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 grids.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to mobile and desktop screens for a seamless experience across devices.
